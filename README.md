# AlphaScreen

AlphaScreen is a package that allows for streamlining pre- and post-processing analysis of AlphaFold screens. It can be utilized through a single script that does the full analysis. 

**Preprocessing**
Before running any AlphaFold prediction, there are two input files that you need:
  1. FASTA file with the sequences you are predicting
  2. Script to submit the prediction to HPC

All files and scripts to help create input files are located in the 'prep' folder.
